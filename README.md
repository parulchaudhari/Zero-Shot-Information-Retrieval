# Zero-Shot-Information-Retrieval
The recent boom in NLP has resulted in a similar boom in the Information Retrieval (IR) domain. With IR, the task is to identify the most relevant documents in a corpus based on a query. For this competition, we have approximately 2,300 queries that more or less resemble questions and about 325,000 documents in the corpus, which is comprised of text files that have been extracted from a variety of VMware public content. Your challenge is to use state-of-the-art information retrieval techniques to find the top five documents that do the best job of answering each question.
